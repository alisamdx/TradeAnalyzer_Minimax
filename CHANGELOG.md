# Changelog

Reverse-chronological. Per spec EP-2.3, this is the index; per-version detail lives in `changelogs/`.

## v0.1.2 — 2026-05-02

Fix `rebuild:electron` so it actually swaps the better-sqlite3 binary's ABI (v0.1.1's `electron-builder install-app-deps` was a no-op when a Node binary was already in place). Replaces both rebuild scripts with a small `scripts/rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs` helper that calls `prebuild-install --force` and derives the Electron target dynamically. `npm run dev` now opens the window cleanly and migrations run.

See [`changelogs/v0.1.2_2026-05-02.md`](changelogs/v0.1.2_2026-05-02.md).

## v0.1.1 — 2026-05-02

Swap DB driver back from `node:sqlite` to `better-sqlite3` 12.x now that VS Build Tools 2022 is installed on the dev box. Drops the `createRequire` workaround and the vitest forks-pool/`node:` externals. Adds paired `rebuild:electron` / `rebuild:node` scripts wired into `predev` / `pretest` so the native binary's ABI always matches the runtime. Tests + typecheck still green; no behavior change.

See [`changelogs/v0.1.1_2026-05-02.md`](changelogs/v0.1.1_2026-05-02.md).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-01

Initial scaffold. Section 7 (Engineering Practices) infrastructure in place. Phase 1 (FR-1 — watchlist management) implemented end-to-end with persistence, CSV round-trip, and tests. No market-data integration yet.

See [`changelogs/v0.1.0_2026-05-01.md`](changelogs/v0.1.0_2026-05-01.md).
